This is a project of reservation system made by Nicholas Cooper, Salim Fathiya and Amine Obeid as an assignment for the course IFT3911 offered at the University of Montreal.

This project aims to make us perfect the theory of conception patterns seen in class and combine them in one design.

When you have the code in front of you, first you need to run it, make sure you are in the class Menus(our main class). 

After that you will be asked if you would like to be treated as an Admin or a Client. 

If you choose to be an Admin you will have control over the application, you can add/modify/delete a company/route/port/vehicle/section and you will also be able to view the Routes from an admin point of view.

If you choose to be a Client you will be able to check Routes from a client point of view, reserve an available siege and pay a reserved siege. 

When you enter anything, the software will check if your data is valid, if it's not you may either be asked to re-enter the value or be redirected to the previous page. 

At any point of your use of the application, you will be directed through what your doing and will have clear instructions on how to interact with tha application.
